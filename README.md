# F1 Race Standings Prediction - Using LSTMs in PyTorch

This Jupyter Notebook is a simple prototype developed as part of my final-year university dissertation. It demonstrates the viability of using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict race standings in Formula 1.

Built using PyTorch.
